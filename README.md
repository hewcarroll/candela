# The Candle-Hour Standard: A Carbon-Energy Framework for Currency Valuation

## Overview

This white paper proposes a utility-backed monetary unit — the **candle-hour** — derived from the thermodynamic energy released by combusting European Pharmacopoeia-grade beeswax through a natural fiber wick over one hour. The framework maps human survival costs in carbon-energy terms to derive a minimum wage from first principles of physics and biology rather than political negotiation.

The key finding: a minimum wage derived purely from thermodynamic survival costs and a health-based 30-hour work week converges on figures consistent with those produced by decades of conventional economic research — suggesting that the minimum wage debate is fundamentally a physics problem obscured by financial abstraction.

## Key Results

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base unit | 1 candle-hour ≈ 60 kcal of carbon-energy via beeswax combustion |
| Currency denomination | 1 candle-hour = 1 cent (base-10 system) |
| Weekly survival cost (single person, high estimate) | 9,000 candle-hours ($90 CH) |
| Minimum wage (30-hour work week) | 300 candle-hours/hour ($3.00 CH/hour) |
| USD conversion rate | $1 CH ≈ $9.33 USD (as of Feb 2026) |
| 1 oz gold | ≈ $532 CH (≈ 53,115 candle-hours) |
| 1 oz silver | ≈ $8.15 CH (≈ 813 candle-hours) |

## Contributing

This paper originated from a thought experiment exploring whether currency could be grounded in fundamental physical utility rather than scarcity, government decree, or cryptographic proof-of-work. Contributions, critiques, and extensions are welcome.
